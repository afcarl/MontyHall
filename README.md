##About this repo:
a simulation of the Monthy Hall problem, in Python. Maybe I should name this repository to MontyPython. 

##Problem definition:
You are on a game show and have to choose one among three doors. Behind one is a new car and behind the other two are goats (caution: this game only works if you'd rather have a car over a goat). The host knows which door has the car. After you choose you door, the host opens one of the two remaining doors, revealing a goat. Now you have two options: stay with your initial choice or switch and choose the other door. Which option offers a higher probability of picking the door with the car? 

##To run the code:
```
src/experiment.py
```
(you can edit the experiment parameters defined in experiment.py if you want to change the number of iterations or number of doors)

##Results (for simulation with 3 doors):
